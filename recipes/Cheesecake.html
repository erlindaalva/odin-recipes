                    <li>1 Stick (200 g) Cream Cheese</li>
                    <li>1/2 Can of NESTLÉ® Condensed Milk</li>
                    <li>4 eggs</li>
                    <li>3 Cups of Strawberries</li>
                    <li>1/2 Cup of Brown Sugar</li>

            <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <h4><ol>
                    <li>Grind the Morochas cookies with a rolling pin. Mix the MOROCHAS cookies with the melted butter until you get a compact dough. Place in a 22 cm diameter mold and press towards the bottom until the whole mold is even. Cool for 20 minutes.</li>
                    <p><strong>Stuffed</strong></p> 
                    <li>In a bowl, beat the cream cheese with the NESTLÉ® Condensed Milk and mix well. Add the eggs one by one, continue beating until the mixture is smooth.</li>
                    <li>Pour the preparation into the mold with the cookie base.</li>
                    <li>Bake at medium temperature in a bain-marie for 50 minutes. To know if it is ready, insert a stick, which must be clean when leaving.</li>
                    <p><strong>Strawberry jam</strong></p>
                    <li>In a pot, place the strawberries cut into quarters and the sugar. Cook over low heat for 15 minutes until thick.</li>
                    <li>Unmold the cheesecake. Cover with the cold strawberry jam. Serve.</li>
